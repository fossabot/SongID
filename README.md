SongID is a Telegram bot that can identify music you send it

The bot downloads audio and video files it get sent on telegram via the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/api), and sends the file to [ACRCloud](https://www.acrcloud.com) for audio recognition processing.

Working with the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/api) is made significantly easier by using the [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) wrapper which simplifies every aspect of the API

## Features
- Identify music within files
- Supports video files
- Supports Telegram audio messages
- Find the name, artist, album, duration and release date of an identified song
- Find an identified song on YouTube, Spotify and Deezer
- Deletes downloaded files as soon as they've been processed
